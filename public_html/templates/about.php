				<p>Every day, millions of animals across the united states lose their lives .  </p>
				<p>More pigeon pie, please. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward. The winds of Winter. As High as Honor. King in the North. The North remembers. Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken. Forgive my manners. I don't see many ladies these days. Lucky for the ladies. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward.</p>
